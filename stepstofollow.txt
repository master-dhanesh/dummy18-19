1. Install required packages for redux toolkit
2. Create folder "store" -> further create a file "store.jsx" in "store" folder
3. Configure store file and export store object and in "main.jsx" wrap <App /> with Provider and pass the store=store
4. In order to store data we need to create "reducers" folder inside "store" folder and in "reducers" folder create desired "Slices" for e.g. "productSlice.jsx" and "userSlice.jsx"
5. In slices write the code to create slice to store data in "initialState" and export reducer(data) and actions(functions)
6. Import slices in store.jsx and add in reducer
7. in order to access data of Store in any component we use "useSelector(cb(state))"
